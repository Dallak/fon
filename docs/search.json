The course then moves on to word stress in simple, compound, and complex and how weak forms are pronounced in a sentence. Then, concepts related to rhythm, assimilation, linking and elision are presented before moving on to the most challenging part of suprasegmental phonology – intonation and its functions. The course concludes with a chapter on varieties of English."

    "section": "9.1 Strong and Weak syllables",
    "text": "9.1 Strong and Weak syllables\n\n9.1 How could we distinguish between weak and strong syllable? Or What are the phonetic characteristics of weak syllables?\n\nThe vowel in a weak syllable tends to be shorter, less loud of lower intensity than the one in strong syllable, for example, in the word /fɑː.ðə/, the weak syllable is the second…why? Because it has a schwa which is shorter than the vowel in the first syllable. Also, the schwa is less loud than the vowel in the first syllable /ɑː/. The schwa cannot occur in strong syllable.\nIf the word has two syllables, one of them has a syllabic consonant (nasals or liquids) with no vowel at all, then syllable that has the syllabic consonant is the weak syllable, for example ‘bottle’ /bɒt.ḷ/.\nAny strong syllable will have its peak one of the vowel phonemes (or possibly a triphthong), but NOT i, u, or ə. If the vowel is short (ɪ, e, æ, Ʌ, ɒ, ʊ), then the strong syllable will always have a coda as well.\n\n\n\n9.1 Position of weak syllables in words\n\nWeak syllables can occur at the end of the word with no coda. Examples: ‘better’ -&gt; [bɛ.tə], ‘happy’ -&gt; [hæ.pi] ‘thank you’ -&gt; [θæŋk. juː].\nWeak syllables also can occur in the word-final position with a coda if the vowel is a schwa ə. Examples: ‘open’ and ‘sharpen’ -&gt; [əʊ.pən] and [ʃɑː.pən].\nWeak syllables can occur also in the word-medial position without codas. Examples: ‘photograph’ and ‘influence’ -&gt; [fəʊ.tə.ɡrɑːf] and [ɪn.flu.əns]\nThe short vowel /ɪ/ can act as a peak without a coda which means it can be a weak syllable only if the following syllable starts with a consonant. Example: ‘architect’ -&gt; [ɑː.kɪ.tekt]\n\n\n\nStressed syllable vs unstressed syllable\n\nStrong syllable is stressed, but weak syllable is unstressed. What does that mean?\nStressed syllable tend to be longer in duration, more prominent, more intense, louder, noticeable than the unstressed syllable.\nStrong syllables often receive primary stress in a word, while weak syllables tend to be unstressed or receive a secondary stress."

    "section": "9.4 Syllabic Consonants",
    "text": "9.4 Syllabic Consonants\n\nNasals and liquids in English are characterised as syllabic consonants. They can occupy the peak of the syllable instead of the vowel and it is considered as a weak syllable. A syllabic consonant is a consonant that forms a syllable of its own.\nThe syllabic consonants replacing the schwa in an unstressed syllable.\nSyllabic consonants are typically indicated by using a diacritic called the syllabic marker, which is a small vertical line placed underneath the consonant symbol, as [n̩], [m̩], [ŋ̩] [l̩] and [r̩]. r̩]).\n\n\n\n9.4.1 Syllabic /l̩/\n\nIt is considered the most noticeable example of syllabic consonant in English. But it would be wrong to expect to find it in all accents.\nSyllabic [l̩] is considered a velarised dark [l].\nIt occurs after another consonant.\nIt always occurs at the end part of the words; not initial or middle.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nPhonetic Transcription\n\n\n\n\nbottle\n[bɒt.l̩]\n\n\ntunnel\n[tʌn.l̩]\n\n\ncattle\n[kæt.l̩]\n\n\nmuddle\n[mʌd.l̩]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Syllabic /n̩/\n\nThe syllabic nasals are [n̩], [m̩] and [ŋ ̩]. However, [n̩] is the most frequently found and the most important one.\nSyllabic n̩ is most common after alveolar plosives and fricatives.\nSyllabic n̩ do not occur after these segments l, ʧ, ʤ. So, that means n is not syllabic in these examples: ‘sullen’, ‘Christian’ and ‘pigeon’ [sʌlən], [krɪsʧən]  and [pɪʤən].\nSyllabic n after non-alveolar consonants is not very common.\nSyllabic n is very common after f and v than [ən] except in word-initial syllables as in [sɛv.n̩], [ɒf.n̩], [hɛv.n̩].\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Syllabic /m̩/ and /ŋ̩/\n\nThese two segments occur as syllabic only as a result of assimilation and elision.\nAssimilation: is a sound change in which some phonemes (typically consonants or vowels) change to become more similar to other nearby sounds.\nElision: is the omission of sounds, syllables or words in speech.\n\nExamples:\n\n‘happen’ would be pronounced as [hæpm̩], [hæpn̩] and [hæpən]\nSyllabic velar nasal is [ŋ]  ‘thicken’ /θɪkŋ̩/\nIn ‘broken key’ /brǝʊkŋ ̩ki:/, where the nasal consonant occurs between two velar consonants.\n\n\n\n\n9.4.5 Syllabic /r̩/\n\nA rhotic accent is an accent that always pronounces the rhotic /r/ consonant sound whenever it appears in words. In most American accents, syllabic r is very common. For instance, the pronunciation of the word ‘particular’ varies based on the accent the speakers use.\n\n\n\n\nAmerican English\nBritish English BBC Speakers\n\n\n\n\n[pɚtɪkələr]\n[pətɪkjələ]\n\n\n\n\nMinimal pairs (a difference in meaning appears to depend on whether a particular r is syllabic or not.\n‘Hungary’ [hʌŋɡr̩i] vs ‘hungry’ [hʌŋɡri]"
