title: "Phonology ENG-3/325"
---


# Course Description

The main purpose of this course is orient students to the suprasegmental features of phonology starting from the very concept of the syllable. The course then moves on to word stress in simple, compound, and complex and how weak forms are pronounced in a sentence. Then, concepts related to rhythm, assimilation, linking and elision are presented before moving on to the most challenging part of suprasegmental phonology â€“ intonation and its functions. The course concludes with a chapter on varieties of English.

# Course Main Objective
The teacher intends to fulfil the following objectives in the course. The key objectives of the course are to:


* Orient students to the concept of the syllable and how to understand syllable division in polysyllabic words
* Demonstrate how stress is placed in simple words based on a set of criteria
* Illustrate the use of stress in compound and complex words based on the parts of speech and on the prefixes and suffixes
* Explain the use of weak forms in regular speech
* Provide an overview of distinctive features
* Distinguish between stress-timed and syllable-timed rhythm
* Describe types of assimilation, linking and elision
* Facilitate understanding of intonation patterns, functions, and parts of the tone unit
* Develop a clear and lucid idea regarding the varieties of English
